The plugin views folder, allows you to override the page displayed based on the page name.

The page name (model) must match the file name inserted into the views/plugin folder for it to work.

It will receive all the data required for the page to load, but allows a more manual way of doing it.

Which in turn allows the user greater control and flexibility in what they want for styling and shit.
